# Todo React App

Simple todo App done using React.

In order to use this test app, clone the repository, navigate to the clonated folder and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
